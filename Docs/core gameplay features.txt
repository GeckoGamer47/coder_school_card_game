Decide:


Idea:
-Each character has their own weapon with different stats

-The player uses the deck during their turn like a normal deckbuilder

-During the enemy's turn, however, the weapon uses the cards like ammo

-each card has a player turn effect and an enemy turn effect

-Bullet speed dependent on weapon, not bullet


either have both separately, each relic has a gun enhancement, or each relic has a random gun enhancement to go with it-
{
-weapon enhancements - affect every bullet and/or the gun's stats

-relics that affect the card gameplay
}

-each character has its own ability (eg dash/dodgeroll, shield, etc)

-player picks a weapon for the run
